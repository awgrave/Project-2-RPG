Silent Suburbia

The sun hung low in the sky, casting long shadows across the manicured
    lawns of Elmwood Estates. I parked my government-issued sedan at the curb, the
    engine’s hum a stark contrast to the silence that enveloped the neighborhood.
    Just hours before, the shrill screams and laughter of children playing rang in
    the entire neighborhood. Now, all was still, as if waiting eagerly for something,
    anything, to happen.

    Next to my torn-up, cheap leather notebook was the weapon I was burdened with
    carrying: The clipboard. It rested on the passenger seat holding the eviction
    notice, its crisp edges a reminder of my purpose here. It's not a fun job;
    no one ever grows up excited to do this, but someone had to. It pays the bills,
    supports the family, well... future family, that is. Plus no one likes their job,
    right? It's a means to an end. It puts the food on my plate, gas in my car, and
    occassional beer in my hand. Yep, livin' the dream.

    I stepped out, adjusting my thin argyle tie, and surveyed the house before me.
    Number 42 Maplewood Drive. A typical suburban abode, complete with a white
    picket fence, blooming azaleas, white toyota camry in the driveway, and a
    rusting swing set in the backyard. The curtains twitched in the window, revealing 
    a glimpse of life inside, before immediately being still, as if it never happened.
    'That can't be right', I muttered to myself. This was supposed to be a quick one. 
    No one had seen or heard from the resident in over a month, they had dissappeared.

    Now I don't spook easily, but... was there really someone there? I blinked twice
    and rubbed my eyes in an attempt to shake off the sleep deprivation. And then
    it hit me. Duh, it was probably just squatters. Those scum of the earth nuisances
    will bury themselves in anything with a roof. Now I've also dealt with enough 
    squatters to know that guns are very easy to get your hands on these days. 
    And I need to be alive to be paid. I'd best just call the cops and have them
    deal with it. But still, something in the back of my mind couldn't help but think
    that that wasn't it either. 

    Glancing at my watch, I noticed that five minutes had already passed since parking.
    I had wasted enough time, I needed to be decisive. Should I ask the neighbors if
    they've heard anything recently?

    I figured there was no harm in asking. I walked across the neatly trimmed lawn, my footsteps 
    muffled by the dew. The neighboring houses stood like silent sentinels, their windows lit by 
    lamplight. I knocked on the door of House number 40, hoping for answers. There was no response.
    As I went to knock again, the lock started shifting and the door slowly swung open.
    An elderly woman peaked her head out, her eyes widening when she saw me, clipboard in hand. 
    "May I help you?" she groaned, her voice a mix between gravel and a whisper, like nails on a chalkboard. 
    “Have you heard anything from the house next door recently? Anything unusual?” She leaned in, 
    her breath warm against my cheek. My head retracted back at the smell of her breath, physically revolting 
    at the soulless stench. “Haven’t seen a soul there in weeks,” she said. Reassured with her answer, 
    I thanked her and started to turn away. "Besides the crying" she whispered. I started to turn 
    back around, convinced I misheard. "Excuse me ma'am, what..." before the door slammed shut.

    As I walked back to the house, my mind raced. Crying? In a vacant house? The hairs on my neck 
    stood on end. There's two logical solutions here, I either misheard, or that old lady is crazy. 
    Both were extremely possible, so I needed to stop worrying and start doing my job. But my
    stomach started to twist, my mind running through all the possibilities. I needed to investigate further. 
    Perhaps the missing resident wasn’t missing at all. Perhaps they were trapped, their cries echoing 
    through the empty rooms. I glanced back at the neighboring house — their windows now dark, 
    as if they too held their breath.

    I returned back to Number 42 Maplewood Drive, my footsteps echoing louder this time. 
    The curtains remained still, but the air held a tension I couldn’t explain. I took a deep breath and knocked, 
    my knuckles rapping against the wood. No answer. Defeated, confused, and extremely tired,
    I was ready to give up. Should I?

I waited and knocked again, but still no response. It's getting late, I should probably give up. Should I?
